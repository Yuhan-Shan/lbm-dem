Signing a contributor agreement is necessary for many reasons. For an overview, see [http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/cla](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/cla). 

You can download the CLA from the repo at [https://github.com/cb-geo/lbm-dem/tree/develop/cla](https://github.com/cb-geo/lbm-dem/tree/develop/cla).
